## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HaseebAhmed2003/Vehicle-classifier.git
    cd Vehicle-classifier
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the `vehicle_classifier.ipynb` notebook.

3. Run the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the vehicle classifier model.

## Model Description

The vehicle classifier is a machine learning model designed to identify and classify various types of vehicles. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Data

The dataset used for training the model should be placed in the `data` directory. Ensure that the data is properly labeled and formatted according to the requirements specified in the notebook.

## Results

The notebook includes evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess the performance of the trained model. Results will be displayed as output cells in the notebook.
